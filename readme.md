# What is this?

The Voting App project for the freeCodeCamp Backend Development Module

## These are User Stories the app should fulfill

As an authenticated user,

- I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
- I can share my polls with my friends.
- I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
- I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
- I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
- if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

As an unauthenticated or authenticated user,

- I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
- I can see the results of polls in chart form.

I also added a requirement that in my opinion is important:

- As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I cannot vote more than once in the same poll.
